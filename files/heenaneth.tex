\maketitle

Now in my dying days, I am laying down this story to you, my son, out of an irregular form of reverance and curiousity towards a tribe which our clan had conquered so many years ago. You should know well that our Lord and Leader Sheigoff, praise to his name, had strictly forbidden the speech on any of those many tribed which his glorious armies had ground to dust. Publically, I intend to keep to that stricture. Still, I feel as if the awkward true of the matter should be carried on secretly, perhaps in your mind, lest when you are desited to be out Lord's advisor, you become too headstrong or oblivious to those otherworldly dangers that lurk in the cults of other tribes.

All of the Gods of all tribes answer prayers in one way or another, and our Gods are certainly most powerful, as they have time and time again led us to victory, but there is another Pantheon which, although not rivalling ours in power, once threatened us with destruction or at least forestallment due to the very specific and singular way that they answered their people's prayer. You should know of this to know it is a possibility.

Before Our Lord unified the land, from the deserts to the sea, there lived many unyoked peoples. Most were unremarkable, and fell to the sword as soon as Our Lord threatened them, but on the lone mountain of Kolash, an ancient cult, the Cult of Heenaneth lived in isolation.

They did not till the fields or trap animals, but lived on the gratuity, or perhaps fear and reverance of the surrounding primitive tribes. It was well known that their Gods were bizarrely active, and whispered very particular knowledge in their ears during some of their clandestine rites, sometimes an absolute certainty about the future that no other form of augery can closely approximate. Their Gods could come alive from their stone idols, as we haphazardly would learn.


\section{The Cosmology of the Cult}

The practitioners of the cult held that in long-gone era, all the tribes in the world worshiped their Father God Heenaneth, a God of knowledge, but this practice waned after some unspoken of disaster. Keeping the Cult of Heenaneth requires very time-consuming rites, and once this disaster, it became impossible for the people of the world to know his presence. The Cult took itself to be the last remnant of worshippers.

As I have said, they did not farm or catch, primarily because such activities would be time consuming, but their few settlements would channel their quite powerful Father God for other tribes for a tithe. The Cult would relay very accurate information about their client's enemies' plans, botanical or military techniques,

Their God was not all-knowing. He could not cause or predict changes in weather or the growing season, like what ours can, but what this demon God did attempt to do, he did with certainty and total reliability.

The God Heenaneth could not speak to men directly, but the Cult held that his power was so sumpreme that it must be channeled through other Gods through mysterious rites, always kept hush, and now lost to time. All over the mountain of Kolash, the cult memebers installed river temples on whatever mountain stream they could. These temples, usually wooden, bore enormous water mills. The Cult held that by milling the water, the river god would allow them to communicate with Heenaneth, but many such mills were needed. Similar mill temples existed for the Wind God. On the mountain and in the crevaces of its valleys, many windmill temples did the same.

Similar forgotten rites existed to channel their sun God many generations passed, but these rites had been lost as they became so difficult to follow with success. Apparently they consisted in some for of Sun-milling, as strange as it sounds, but the craftmanship required was far advanced for the Cult as it then existed. By my days, these techniques had totally been lost to time, and Sun-worship was nigh unheard of in the Cult.

The demon God Heenaneth was worshipped in one central temple which marked the zenith of the Cult's settlement on the mountain.  The insides of this temple I shall repeat in due time, but they were beyond what I have ever seen. Needless to say, Our Lord Sheigoff had the temple destroyed, after all we would endure to end the cult.
